## Repo Clean-Up Tasks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[] run-scripts update :
	- As of now, the scripts require manual setting of the parameters in the script. Change it to be able to pass parameters instead of changing the tokens.
	- Reduce the number of scripts if possible.

[] organize scripts for analysis :
	- The analysis scripts are all scattered and I probably don't even remember what are the use for each of them.
	- Need to organize that for analysis in the later half of the experiments.

[] Write a documentation : 
	- For which requirements file is for which experiment case
	- Make a cmd file to organize it into one command. Remove intervention.
