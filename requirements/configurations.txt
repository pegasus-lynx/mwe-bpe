How to install requirements for different configurations : 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First step is to install requirements-base.txt : 

	pip install -r requirements-base.txt

Next we will install nlcodec and rtg.
For this we use custom-install.sh with different parameters : 

	There are three parameters :
		b | nlcodec_branch 
			- mwe_schemes : Genreal purpose, for running experiments ( default )
			- decode_hack : Used for getting decode outputs consisting of individual tokens
			- ext-ngram   : Used for ext bi + tri only experiments

		r | rtg_version 
			- 0.6.0	      : Latest
			- 0.4.0	      : Used in general for our experiments ( default )

		c | custom_rtg flag
			- To be used to setup the environment when normal installation of rtg is not able to decode the experiments
			- i.e. rtg-decode is not working with vocab mismatch / index out of bound issue

	Examples : 
		requirements-sent.txt	->	requirements-base.txt 
						custom_install.sh -c
	
		requirements-060.txt	->	requirements-base.txt 
						custom_install.sh -r 0.6.0

		requirements-bitri.txt	-> 	requirements-base.txt
						custom_install.sh -b ext-ngram

		requirements-decode.txt	->	requirements-base.txt 
						custom_install.sh -b decode_hack

		requirements-mwe.txt	->	requirements-base.txt 
						custom_install.sh
